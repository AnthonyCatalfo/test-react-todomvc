## Implementation

I used create-react-app to get my build environment set up because of its flexibility and stability.
I have created this  Todo app using ideas and code from the websites and articles listed. I did not get any help from any person while creating this project.

My thought process was to make a todo app that did not violate any best practices and could be expanded if desired.
I first wrote my code entirely on the App page because it made it easier to follow the code's logic and tweak it if necessary. I broke out the code into a Container Component(App) and Presentation Components(TodoForm, TodoItem, TodoList). I intentionally kept the css to a minimum so it would not distract the designer.
